## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS
- Parcel
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I was learning SASS and Js and thought of doing a cool project using these technologies and found the perfect beginner-friendly project on frontend-mentor. Though I went overboard with SASS and I need some practice with it, it turned out to help clear out some doubts and helped me get started with these technologies.
